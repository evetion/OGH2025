We want a language that's homoiconic, with true macros like Lisp, but with obvious, familiar mathematical notation like Matlab. We want something as usable for general programming as Python, as easy for statistics as R, as natural for string processing as Perl, as powerful for linear algebra as Matlab, as good at gluing programs together as the shell. Something that is dirt simple to learn, yet keeps the most serious hackers happy. We want it interactive and we want it compiled."

The language was still in its infancy, so there were some issues, but it generally worked well and enabled us to process the billions of lidar points for our elevation mapping project in Indonesia. The used and generated packages are now part of JuliaGeo: https://juliageo.org/, with geospatial libraries linked such as GDAL, GEOS, Proj etc. Nowadays, we build open-source numerical models in Julia, such as [Wflow.jl](https://github.com/Deltares/Wflow.jl) and [Ribasim.jl](https://github.com/Deltares/Ribasim)."
